Simple test certificate

Don't use them in real life!


Root CA: CA/CA.crt
Intermediate Client CA: CA/imc.crt
Intermediate Server CA: CA/ims.crt

Client Certificate: client/username.crt
Server Certificate: server/localhost.crt



'flow' uses certificates by their names. So if a users name
(name ist alias) is 'username', his/here certificate has to be
named 'username.crt' and it has to be issued for a
"Common Name (CN)=username" by the intermediate client CA 'CA/imc.crt'

'flowclient' will use certificate this way
'flowserver' will check certificate this way

'flowclient' will not check the CN of the server certificate nor
will it check for the chain. The client trusts 'trusted
server certificates' which means certificates set to be trustet
for the flowclient by the user.

Further 'flowclient' trusts user certificates the same way.


The overhead of producing and managing openly trusted certificates
is proofen too demanding to do even business, let alone fun
communication.

Nevertheless, if clients are strict, the mechanism provides the
same security than professional certificates.


You need the certificates in this package to play with the
examples and have an easy go if you wish to contribute. These
certificate do not provide any security at all, given that
their private components are accessible for everyone.
