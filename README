'flow' is a communication system

goal:
-----
it will move your messages in protected mode

'your messages' means messages from your + message for you

using certificates for transport security (TLS) and content encryption, flow
will enable you to exchange messages securely not only using insecure networks
but also using untrusted message exchange servers.

the system will give you realtime and asynchronous message exchange and
message distribution capability

because all 'flow' data are secure, they may be stored anywhere for unlimited
time. so, if you lose your message history or dialog history, you should be able
to recall all of them from the 'flow' server you used, given, the server stores
youe data

DATA MUST FLOW!


'flow' will
-----------
enable you to exchange messages even through smartphones and tablet computers
enalbe you to build protected groups to communicate with


for security reason 'flow' may never
------------------------------------
enalbe unsafe message exchange
get an official MS Windows version

'flow' is not 
-------------
a public social community system
a system to exchange data with public social community systems


current status
--------------
the server is able to receive data from the client and keeps them in his memory
the client is able to connect to a remote server and send a message there

next steps
----------
the client should remember some important command line information
the client should be able to request messages from the server and recontruct

a development CA and certificates are to create

TLS on all your ways
data compression
data encryption
