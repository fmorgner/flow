'flow' -- how to build the binaries

destination systems
-------------------

'flow' is intended to run on as much systems as possible using compilers as
GCC or CLANG. 

'flow' is CPU independend. Testers were able to run the binaries local and
remote, merging operating systems and CPUs from this list:

 * Linux, MacOS
 * x86, ppc
 * 32bit, 64bit

build process
-------------

To build the whole project simply run 'make' in the base directory of the
project.

You may change the compiler setting the CC value at the start of the Makefile
to either g++ or clang. Using clang may produce better results.

As far as the compiler supports it, the resulting binaries are

dependencies
------------

 * libc
 * libstdc++
 * libpthread
 * libssl
