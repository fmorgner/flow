'flow' -- How it works

Copyright (C) 2010 Manfred Morgner manfred@morgner.com

'flow' consists of two parts a client and a server. One user of a flowclient
send messages to other user(s) of flowclient using a server system

 1) one client sends messages encrypted to the server
 2) the server stores the messages
 3) ontoher client calls the messages sent for him from the server

The server may or may not check if the client is who he claims he is for the
simple reasomn that, if he is not one of the true recipients, he will be
unable to decrypt the messages he got.

Clients may request messages by time or message identification code by asking

 * next message after <time or id>
 * all messages after <time or id>
