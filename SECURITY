== A short discussion about trust and security in personal communication by
using certificates

Preposition: I assume you know real life people you trust and wish to
             trustfully communicate with

What does an official certificate authority certificy?

First things first, there is no such thing as an official certificate authority!

Being a certificate authority (CA) is a business, not a governmental service. But
even if it was a governmental service, there is no 'world-government'. And even
if there was a world-government, would you trust them to secure
your private communication? 

So, who is trustworthy enough to be entrusted by for you?

You!

SSL implements a trust model which expects you to trust CAs to care for your
trustees. Which may be acceptable if you do business using SSL.

For private communication the matter is complex, but can be reduced to one
line of argumentation.


You need to ensure, that trust is something you are able to manage. CAs don't
help. So the last piece of information which remains is your communication partners certificate.
Regardless of who signed it or even if it is signed at all.

If your friend gave you his keys, it would be unusual behavior of you
not to accept them because you don't know the manufacturer.

So, if you look deep in the implementation of 'flow' you will find out, that
flow seems to trust every certificate. If you see it this way, you are looking
at it the wrong way.

Important for trust is the 'Trust Path', the path where the trusted
certificates lives.

If you copy a certificate to this place, 'flow' will trust it.

This way, the responsibility to ensure who to trust is given back to you.

But remember, if you copy a CA to this place, 'flow' will at least trust all
certificates directly issued by this CA. If a partner delivers a CA chain, 
'flow' trusts the partner if the chain ends on a trusted CA certificate.

So be careful which CA you copy into your 'Trust Path'
